# Linear Regression Model to Predict House Prices üè†üí∞


# Overview

  This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on various features like total square footage, number of bathrooms, bedrooms, and other property characteristics. The dataset used in this project is available in the train.csv file.


# Dataset

  The dataset contains information on house properties and their corresponding sale prices.

# Important features include:

  * TotalSquareFeet: Sum of all floor areas in the house.
  * TotalFullBaths and TotalHalfBaths: Combined counts of full and half bathrooms.
  * YearBuilt, GarageArea, LotArea, and other structural details.


# Libraries Used
   * pandas for data manipulation
   * numpy for numerical operations
   * seaborn and matplotlib for visualizations
   * sklearn.preprocessing for feature scaling
   * sklearn.model_selection for splitting the data
   * sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression for building the model
   * sklearn.metrics for evaluating the model
